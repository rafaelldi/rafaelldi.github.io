In this post, I add some metrics to ASP.NET Core application. We’ll discuss why monitoring is so important and how we can deal with it.

# Monitoring
Monitoring is one of the methods to understand what is happening with your application in production. As I said in the [previous post]({% post_url 2019-07-14-asp-net-core-logs-part-1 %}), we use logging for similar purposes. What is the difference between monitoring and logging? Metrics are all almost about numbers, on the other hand, logs are all almost about a text. With the monitoring, you collect a lot of data, but you don’t read it, you just control that the measurements are within acceptable limits. Logging, contrariwise, is very useful in situations when you need to know what exactly happened,  you can read stack trace, some useful messages, variable values. Of  course, you can understand, for example, the amount of exceptions with  your logs, but monitoring is more essential for these purposes.

In this article, I’ll mostly write about [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), but there are more useful tools here, and you can choose which of that more appropriate for you. Firstly, I need to mention the TICK stack ([Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/), [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/), [Chronograf](https://docs.influxdata.com/chronograf/v1.7/), [Kapacitor](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1.5/)), it is a very powerful alternative to Prometheus and Grafana. Secondly, there is a [library App Metrics](https://github.com/AppMetrics/AppMetrics), that allows you to collect metrics from your .NET application and  export them to a database, for example, Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elacticsearch. I won’t consider these solutions, because I don’t have enough experience with them.

I’ve created a [github repository](https://github.com/rafaelldi/AspNetCoreAppMetrics) for this article.

# Prometheus-net
To start with, let’s collect some metrics. You need to add [this library](https://github.com/prometheus-net/prometheus-net) and modify your Startup class.

```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        app.UseMetricServer();
        app.UseHttpMetrics();
        
        app.UseRouting();

        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

And that’s all, go to `/metrics` and you’ll see some default measurements.

```

# Prometheus
Of course, it is very inconvenient  to see such information in a text form. We want to use a tool, which will keep that data, aggregate and create some plots. As I mentioned early, we’ll use [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for these purposes.

As always, I’ll start everything in Docker containers because it’s fast and simple. Here I prepared a docker-compose script.

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  api:
    build: .
    container_name: api
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    depends_on:
      - prometheus

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

Besides, you need to add this configuration file.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: api
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['api:80']
```

When all preparations are finished, go to the `http://localhost:9090/`.

In this interface you can create different charts, but, for honest, it is not a super convenient interface.

# Grafana
Grafana is a solution, that allows you to visualize metrics from various data storages. This is a docker-compose script to run them all.

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  api:
    build: .
    container_name: api
    ports:
      - "5000:80"
    depends_on:
      - prometheus
      - grafana

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./prometheus/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - prometheus 
```

Go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you’ll see the login page. The default username and password is `admin` and `admin`.

On the next page add a new data source.

![Add dashboard](/assets/images/2019-11-02-asp-net-core-metrics/add-dashboard.png)

Choose `Prometheus` and set url `http://prometheus:9090`.

![Add prometheus data source](/assets/images/2019-11-02-asp-net-core-metrics/add-data-source.png)

![Configure prometheus data source](/assets/images/2019-11-02-asp-net-core-metrics/configure-prometheus-source.png)

After that, you need to import dashboards for your data. You can create your own, but there are [two templates](https://github.com/prometheus-net/grafana-dashboards) for prometheus-net library. Click `+ -> Import` and paste dashboard id ([10427](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10427) or [10915](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10915)).

![Add new dashboard](/assets/images/2019-11-02-asp-net-core-metrics/add-dashboard.png)

Set parameters and data source.

![Configure new dashboard](/assets/images/2019-11-02-asp-net-core-metrics/configure-dashboard.png)

Now you have two dashboards and beautiful charts.

# Business Metrics
Sometimes you want to monitor your own metrics, for example, a number of visitors per hour. In this section, we’ll consider how to create a custom measurement.

First  of all, there are four metric types in Prometheus: counter, gauge, histogram and summary. I won’t dive into differences between them, because it is well explained in the [docs](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/). We’ll use a histogram.

> Histograms track the size and number of events in buckets. This allows for aggregatable calculation of quantiles.

Let’s modify the default weather controller.

```csharp
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class WeatherForecastController : ControllerBase
{
    private static readonly string[] Summaries = new[]
    {
        "Freezing", "Bracing", "Chilly", "Cool", "Mild", "Warm", "Balmy", "Hot", "Sweltering", "Scorching"
    };

    private readonly ILogger<WeatherForecastController> _logger;

    public WeatherForecastController(ILogger<WeatherForecastController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public WeatherForecast Get()
    {
        var rng = new Random();
        var forecast = new WeatherForecast
        {
            Date = DateTime.Now.AddDays(1),
            TemperatureC = rng.Next(-20, 30),
            Summary = Summaries[rng.Next(Summaries.Length)]
        };

        var histogram = Metrics.CreateHistogram(
            "temperature_with_summary",
            "Temperature buckets divided by summary",
            new HistogramConfiguration
            {
                LabelNames = new []{"Summary"},
                Buckets = Histogram.LinearBuckets(-20, 10, 6)
            }
        );
        histogram
            .WithLabels(forecast.Summary)
            .Observe(forecast.TemperatureC);
        
        return forecast;
    }
}
```

I’ve created a histogram with the name `temperature_with_summary` and six buckets. Also, I’ve put a label of weather [type](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/instrumentation/#use-labels).

Now, go to Grafana and create a new dashboard.

![Custom empty dashboard](/assets/images/2019-11-02-asp-net-core-metrics/custom-empty-dashboard.png)

You can specify a query, different parameters, a graph. I’ve used a formula `temperature_with_summary_sum`/`temperature_with_summary_count` to calculate an average temperature for different weather types.

![Custom dashboard](/assets/images/2019-11-02-asp-net-core-metrics/custom-dashboard.png)

Of course, there are plenty of options to customize and compute your metrics. I’ve shown just a simple example.

# Metrics from Docker
In the last section, I’ll explain how to monitor docker engine itself. Firstly, you need to modify (or create) daemon.json file. It is located in the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` folder by default (for Windows it is `C:\ProgramData\docker\config\daemon.json`). And reload docker engine.

```json
{
  "metrics-addr" : "0.0.0.0:9323",
  "experimental" : true
}
```

After that, go to `127.0.0.1:9323/metrics` and you’ll see different metrics from docker.

![Docker metrics](/assets/images/2019-11-02-asp-net-core-metrics/docker-metrics.png)

Next, specify a new job for Prometheus to grab these metrics.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: api
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['api:80']

  - job_name: docker
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['172.17.0.1:9323']
```

One point here is how to find out ip address (`172.17.0.1` above). In Windows you can simply use `host.docker.internal`. In Ubuntu run `ip addr show docker0` command in the terminal.

```
5: docker0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state DOWN group default 
    link/ether 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
    inet6 fe80::42:b1ff:fec0:82de/64 scope link 
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

Finally, you’ll have a new target and metric in your Prometheus.

# Conclusion
In this post we’ve discovered how to monitor web application. This is a pretty big topic, so a lot of things are left behind. We examined basic examples that help you take the first step in this area.
