Hi, my name is Rival, and I am a .NET developer. I try to learn new technologies, tools, approaches and experiment with code in my free time. In this blog, I talk about the results of my research. I will be happy if these articles help you learn something new or give you some interesting ideas. 

I understand that my solutions may not be the most optimal or contain errors, so I caution you not to use them in production without any testing. If you'd like to discuss any articles, ask questions, or know better solutions, feel free to leave comments. If you find any errors, please let me know about them. Thanks for stopping by my blog.
